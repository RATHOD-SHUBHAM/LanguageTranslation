# Language Detection and Translation

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) for detecting the language of a given text and translating it into different languages using various models and libraries.

## Features:
- **Language Detection:** Detects the language of input text using different models.
- **Translation:** Translates text from the detected language into a specified target language.
- **Interactive Notebooks:** Each notebook walks through the code with explanations, allowing for easy understanding and modification.
- **Libraries Used:** Popular Python libraries like `HuggingFace`, `googletrans`, `transformers`, `Deep Translator`, and more are utilized to build the models.

## Notebooks:
1. `Huggingface_pipeline.ipynb` - A notebook for translating text from one language to another using the huggingface transformer pipeline.
2. `languageIdentification_translation.ipynb` - A notebook for detecting languages automatically and translating text from one language to another.
3. `DeepTranslator.ipynb` - A notebook for detecting languages automatically and translating text from one language to another.

## Requirements:
To run the notebooks locally, you will need the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install -qU transformers fastext deep-translator
